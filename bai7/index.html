    A smile face is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is
    belived it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the
    eyes, an action known as a "Duchene smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be preceived as
    insincere.
